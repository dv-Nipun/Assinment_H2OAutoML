# Assinment_H2OAutoML
# Code Explanation

# The provided Jupyter Notebook H2O_AutoML_Example.ipynb contains the code for using H2O AutoML on the Iris dataset. It covers the following steps:

    Installing the H2O library and initializing a local H2O cluster.
    Loading the dataset and splitting it into training and validation sets.
    Defining the response and predictor variables.
    Initializing the H2O AutoML model with desired configurations.
    Training the AutoML model and obtaining the best model.
    Displaying the leaderboard, best model information, scoring history, and variable importances.
    Printing the size of the training set.

# Dataset

The example uses the Iris dataset (iris.csv) as a demonstration. You can replace it with your own dataset by modifying the csv_path variable in the notebook.
